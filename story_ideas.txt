When I was younger my father took me to the city for the day. We bought this at a small store.
Our family pet died when I was too young to remember them. This was their favourite toy.
We always hoped to buy a house and have a family. In my first payday I bought two of these.
No, I don't remember where we got this. It was my daughter's favourite toy on long car rides.
I never got to show this to my friend before they left for college, but I always meant to.
My partner showed this to me on our first date. They were so proud, it was infectious.
